               <p>
                   <div>Here is something interesting about my first name.</div>
                   <div>My name is actually two charactors <strong>Wen</strong> and <strong>Qing</strong>, Wen means gental and quiet.</div>
                   <div>I guess my parents wanted me to be a cute girl when I was born, but sadly I have nothing to do with it.üôÑ</div>
                   <div>Many people don't know how to read my name. To be honest I don't really mind if someone makes a mistake on it.</div>
               </p>

               <p>
                   <div>I studied <em>Electrical Engineering and Automation</em> in university.</div> 
                   <div>I don't like it at all, but I still planned to get a master degree aboard.</div>
                   <div>I found <em>Interactive Media Design</em> is far more interesting than what I studied before.</div>
                   <div>Although I'm just a beginner now, I hope I can be better in the future.</div>
