                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                    <p>
                        Here is something interesting about my first name.
                        My name is actually two charactors <strong>Wen</strong> and <strong>Qing</strong>, Wen means gental and quiet.
                        I guess my parents wanted me to be a cute girl when I was born, but sadly I have nothing to do with it.üôÑ
                        Many people don't know how to read my name. To be honest I don't really mind if someone makes a mistake on it.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        I studied <em>Electrical Engineering and Automation</em> in university.
                        I don't like it at all, but I still planned to get a master degree aboard.
                        I found <em>Interactive Media Design</em> is far more interesting than what I studied before.
                        Although I'm just a beginner now, I hope I can be better in the future.
                    </p>
